##  📈AI News Agent using n8n 

## 📌 Project Description

This project is an AI-powered News Automation Agent built using n8n, Google Gemini AI, and RSS feeds. It automatically fetches the latest news from selected sources, processes and filters the content using JavaScript, summarizes it using an AI agent, and sends the final formatted news updates directly to a messaging platform like Telegram.

This system removes the need for manual news tracking by providing real-time, summarized, and easy-to-read news updates at scheduled intervals.
